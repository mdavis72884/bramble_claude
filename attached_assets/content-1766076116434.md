**ABOUT THE CLIENT**

Founded in 1967, Mississippi Valley Montessori School is an AMI-accredited non-profit organization that provides respectful, supportive, child-led learning in thoughtfully prepared and inspirational classrooms, allowing children to explore their natural curiosities, gain confidence, and follow a path to independence. By fostering an inclusive community of learners where every child is celebrated and respected, they help children not only thrive academically but also feel a sense of belonging, understand their role in the world around them, and become their best selves.

MVMS wanted to transform their brand and finally "look the part" as an established and well-loved authentic Montessori school (the second oldest in Minnesota). Our goal was to strengthen their brand presence with a warm, intentional, down-to-earth visual identity and modern, easy-to-navigate [**website**](https://www.mvmontessori.org/) that helps the school increase enrollment, attract more like-minded families who share their ethos, and prepare to expand their program to serve younger children when they open a toddler classroom.

**INSPO BEHIND THE DESIGN**

## The illustrative symbol is the star of the show, giving a nod to the previous MVMS logo and their location along the Mississippi. The winding river speaks to the school’s child-led approach, the journey of learning, the importance of nature in the Montessori method, and guiding children as they follow their curiosities and grow into the people they’re meant to be.
