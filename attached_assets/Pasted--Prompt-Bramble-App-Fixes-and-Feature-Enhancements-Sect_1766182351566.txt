## Prompt: Bramble App Fixes and Feature Enhancements

---

### Section 1: General System Integration and Fixes // Phase 1

✅ Perform a complete integration pass to ensure all real backend API connections are live and working across all roles. Replace all mock data with actual database-linked content.

* Family Dashboard: class enrollment, RSVP, child management, order view
* Instructor Dashboard: view rosters, add notes, see earnings and payout status
* Admin Dashboard: save and update settings (branding, pricing, classes, events, announcements), review/approve users
* Chat: real messaging for class chats and main co-op chat

✅ All buttons, links, and interactions should function without errors. Fix broken buttons and any dead ends across the platform.

✅ Visual indicators (badges, highlights, etc.) should appear for:

* Pending applications
* New messages
* Announcements
* Unread items

✅ All cards and items (classes, events, chats, resources) should be clickable and lead to logical destinations or popups with more info.

🚨 Known issue: Some buttons and flows (like “Starter Pack”) appear present in the UI but are currently non-functional or misleading. Please audit and either activate or hide appropriately.

---

### Section 2: Calendar and Scheduling // Phase 2

✅ Add a calendar view for **Co-op Admins** — same logic and layout as Family view.

✅ Events and classes on calendar must:

* Be clickable → popup or navigate to item with basic info (date, time, instructor, location, enrolled children)
* Show proper overflow ("+X more" expands)
* Include optional daily/weekly view toggle if feasible without heavy UI burden

✅ Instructors should have a **read-only calendar view** to help avoid scheduling conflicts.

✅ Ensure mobile responsiveness across calendar views.

---

### Section 3: Role Management and Switching // Phase 2

✅ Users can hold multiple roles (e.g., Co-op Admin + Family + Instructor).

✅ Add a **simple UI switcher (tab or dropdown)** to toggle between dashboards relevant to each role.

✅ Co-op Admins must be able to assign additional roles to users (e.g., make Instructor also a Parent or Admin).

✅ Each role's features and permissions should display accordingly when toggled.

🔄 Maintain clear breadcrumb or visual indicator to show active role.

---

### Section 4: Class & Instructor Management // Phase 3

✅ Co-op Admins should be able to:

* Create, suspend, and delete instructors (with clear warnings)
* Manage instructor roles and see application status

✅ Instructors should be able to:

* Create class drafts and submit for approval
* View/manage sessions, notes, rosters
* Edit class (where allowed); certain changes should trigger admin re-approval
* Message enrolled families via class chats or announcements
* See relevant family info (names, contact)

✅ Instructor Dashboard improvements:

* Show class info visually (enrollment count, sessions, payouts)
* Include smart filters for payouts and classes (by student, family, class, etc.)

✅ Add visual consistency with Bramble’s design system (typography, spacing, styling).

---

### Section 5: Payments & Receipts // Phase 3

✅ Payment Workflow:

* Paid class enrollment triggers payment and receipt
* Free classes/events bypass payment, auto-enroll
* Events follow same logic

✅ Receipt generator:

* Available for paid classes only
* Shows class title, child name, parent name, amount, date
* Downloadable/printable PDF format

✅ Admin/Instructor payment views:

* Add filters: by class, family, date, status
* Clear summary: pending, paid, historical totals

✅ Responsive layout for mobile use

---

### Section 6: Communications Hub // Phase 4

✅ Rebuild the Communications Hub with visual editing tools (like the landing page editor):

* Support styled newsletters, automations, and targeted messages
* Provide 3 layout templates
* Allow image uploads or auto-suggested stock images
* Preview before send

✅ Automations UI should be non-technical:

* Formatted with readable trigger/action lists
* Bramble controls defaults; co-ops can override and add their own

✅ Admin Chat Access:

* Co-op Admins must see/manage chats
* Add menu link and access panel
* Allow admin to manage chat groups per class
* Optional: global instructor chat channel

✅ Chat Logic:

* Main co-op chat includes families, optionally instructors
* Class chats created automatically per class
* Event chat = NO, unless admin manually enables

✅ Badge alerts and visual highlights for new chats/messages

---

### Section 7: Email System // Phase 4

✅ Set up **simple, non-API-based email system** for one-way emails:

* Separate systems for Bramble and each Co-op
* Admins can send to selected groups
* Emails are logged; no replies handled (1-way only)

✅ UI should include:

* Email composer with title, body, image upload, preview
* Send test email option
* History of emails sent

✅ Align visually with platform UI style

---

### Section 8: Bramble Admin Access & Safety // Phase 1

✅ Bramble Operator (Platform Admin) must be able to:

* Access all tenants
* View/manage tenant users, emails, content (read-only or editable via impersonation only)
* Use impersonation tool to act as tenant member for support

✅ Add deletion safeguards:

* Confirmations before deleting anything (users, content, tenants)
* Optional soft-delete or recovery layer

✅ Add global task audit to ensure platform admin can troubleshoot end-to-end.

🛑 Bramble should not have access to direct communications between users unless impersonation mode is activated.

---

### Section 9: Visual Templates & Starter Content // Phase 2

✅ Replace "Starter Pack" logic with:

* Visual Demo Mode (preloaded dummy content for new users)
* Template Manager (for Bramble to define email templates, resources, example events, etc.)

✅ Admin can toggle which content gets included by default.

✅ Visually styled content should feel branded and guided.

---

### Section 10: Miscellaneous // Continuous

✅ Curriculum & Resource sections must be visible and usable per tenant

✅ Add 2 test users per role for all environments (Family, Instructor, Admin, Operator)

✅ Learning styles/preferences must be part of child info form:

* Editable by family and co-op admin
* Default list managed by Bramble
