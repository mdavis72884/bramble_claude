ok, so if this is my final initial prompt, what would be the best practices for starting this build in replit:


- NEW BUILD initiAL PRompt:
    
    # Project Name
    
    Bramble
    
    # Overview
    
    Bramble is a **white-labeled operating system for homeschool co-ops**.
    
    It’s the system a co-op uses to run everything in one place—**memberships, classes, events, instructors, families, communication, resources, and payments**—without replacing the co-op’s identity.
    
    Families don’t join Bramble. They join **their co-op**, which happens to be powered by Bramble.
    
    Bramble’s job is to stay invisible so the co-op’s culture and brand can stay front and center.

    # Visual & UX Style
    
    Match the style and user experience shown in this Figma reference:
    👉 [Figma UI Reference](https://www.figma.com/design/BMEWkB0OiaBzF7hYLyfHWz/Replit?node-id=0-1)
    
    Design principles:
    
    - Calm, editorial, and human
    - Not SaaS-y or startup-like
    - No social features, no feeds
    - Users should feel oriented and supported, not overwhelmed
    
    ---
    
    # Target Platform
    
    - Web-based SaaS platform
    - Fully responsive (mobile-first design encouraged)
    - Online only
    - Use Replit’s built-in hosting for MVP
    - Must be easy to maintain by a **non-developer**
    
    ---
    
    # Roles & Permissions
    
    ### Global: Platform Owner (You / Bramble)
    
    - Approves all co-op creation requests
    - Manages platform-wide settings and branding defaults
    - Has impersonation and override tools
    - Invisible in the user interface to all co-op members
    
    ### Scoped to Co-op:
    
    Each user belongs to one co-op and can hold **multiple roles** inside it:
    
    - Co-op Admin
    - Sub-admin
    - Instructor
    - Parent
    
    Permissions are contextual:
    
    > “What role does this user have inside this co-op?”
    >

    # Co-op Onboarding Flow (Critical)
    
    1. **Apply to Create a Co-op**
        - Any user can apply to start a new co-op via Bramble
        - Application includes: co-op name, location, description, estimated size
        - Stored as `pending`, `approved`, or `denied`
    2. **Platform Owner Approves**
        - Once approved, the co-op is created
        - The applicant becomes its **Co-op Admin**
    3. **Co-op Setup Begins**
        - Admin sets logo, colors, mission, basic info
        - Receives a unique co-op URL/tenant
    4. **Parents & Instructors Join**
        - Families apply to join specific co-ops
        - Co-op Admin reviews and approves them
        - Users cannot browse other co-ops once assigned

    - Use environment variables for secrets (Stripe, keys)
    - Avoid excessive libraries unless needed
    - Match Replit’s zero-setup model

    # Task: Add Developer Test Users and Easy Navigation
    
    ## Goal:
    
    Set up test users and create developer-friendly access for demoing roles and UI flows.
    
    ## Features to Add:
    
    ### 1. Login Page Modifications:
    
    - Show a list of clickable test user accounts
    - When clicked, auto-fill login form with email/password
    - Use a secure method (e.g., dev mode flag) to expose this only during testing
    
    ### 2. Create Sample Users:
    
    Seed the database with:
    
    - One Platform Owner (hidden from UI)
    - One Co-op Admin (for a test co-op)
    - One Instructor
    - One Parent (with two children)
    - One Sub-admin
    
    All users belong to the same demo co-op (e.g., “Oak Hollow”).
    
    Each user has:
    
    - Email + password
    - Display name
    - Predefined role assignments
    
    ### 3. Navigation Tool:
    
    Add a temporary “All Pages” link on the homepage or nav that:
    
    - Lists all major routes (e.g., `/dashboard`, `/classes`, `/resources`)
    - Links to them directly
    - Helps with fast testing
    
    Mark this tool as:
    
    > “Developer Mode Only — remove before production.”
    > 
    
    # Task: Build a Co-op Landing Page Generator
    
    ## Goal:
    
    Each co-op has its own public-facing website at `/c/{co-op-slug}` for discovery and joining.
    
    ## Features:
    
    ### 1. Public URL
    
    - Each co-op gets a unique landing page:
        - `/c/{co-op-slug}` (e.g., `/c/oak-hollow`)
    - Page is publicly accessible
    - Shows only published content (no login required)
    
    ### 2. Layout Templates
    
    Offer 3 layout styles:
    
    - **Classic** – Large hero image, flowing sections, soft colors
    - **Modern** – Fixed nav bar, full-screen hero, dynamic feel
    - **Minimal** – Clean, text-centered, minimal visuals
    
    Template selected in admin dashboard
    
    ### 3. Configurable Content Sections
    
    Each co-op admin can control:
    
    - **Hero header** (upload or choose stock background)
    - Co-op name + tagline
    - "About Us" (rich text)
    - **Pricing info** (text or table)
    - **Announcements** (admin-managed)
    - Toggle: Show/hide published classes
    - Toggle: Show/hide published events
    - Contact info + footer (email, location, optional phone)
    
    ### 4. Branding Controls
    
    Admins choose:
    
    - Layout style
    - Primary + secondary color
    - Logo
    - Header image (stock themes: nature, garden, learning, etc.)
    
    All branding settings live in:
    
    > Co-op Admin Dashboard → Branding Section
    > 
    
    ### 5. Public Page Actions
    
    Include:
    
    - View classes (no login needed)
    - View events
    - “Join” button → links to co-op signup
    - “Login” button → login form scoped to that co-op
    
    ## Notes:
    
    - This landing page replaces the need for co-ops to build their own websites
    - Content is controlled 100% by the co-op admin — Bramble never overrides
