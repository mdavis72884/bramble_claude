## 6. Dashboards Are Context Hubs (Not Dead Ends) Dashboards should let users **see and understand everything important without leaving**. **Rule:** - Dashboards **surface full context** - Modals **expand details** - Pages are only for **deep work or creation** What this means in practice: - Clicking an event, class, or message on the dashboard opens a **modal with full, useful detail** - Users should be able to: - Read - RSVP - See status - Close and immediately see the next item - No forced page navigation just to “see more” **Still true:** - Dashboards do not create or edit core objects - Dashboards do not replace full management pages - Creation and heavy editing still live on dedicated pages **Simple test:** If a user has to leave the dashboard just to understand what’s happening next or full context, the dashboard is failing. This keeps navigation minimal **without turning the dashboard into a mess**. ## The 3-Level Page Model (Non-Negotiable) Every screen in Bramble must clearly be **one** of these. No mixing. --- ## 1. OVERVIEW (Dashboards) **Purpose:** Orientation **Question it answers:** *“What matters right now?”* **Who has one:** - Parent - Instructor - Co-op Admin - Platform Owner **Rules:** - Time-based information only - Read-only summaries - Click opens **modals** for detail - No creation, no deep editing - User should understand everything without leaving **Examples:** - Parent Overview - Instructor Overview - Co-op Admin Overview --- ## 2. HUBS (Working Areas) **Purpose:** Ongoing work **Question it answers:** *“Let me work here.”* **Rules:** - Scrollable - Calm, editorial - Rich content allowed - Creation and editing allowed - No urgency **Examples:** - Family → Children - Classes (list) - Events (list) - Curriculum Hub - Resource Hub - Communications Hub --- ## 3. WORKSPACES (Managed Objects) **Purpose:** Focused management **Question it answers:** *“Everything about this one thing.”* **Rules:** - Full context visible - No thin detail pages - Sections instead of empty tabs - Primary place for real work **Examples:** - Child page - Class management page - Event management page - Instructor management page - Curriculum structure page --- ## How to Apply This (Simple Test) For **every page**, ask: > Is this about NOW, WORK, or ONE THING? > - NOW → Overview - WORK → Hub - ONE THING → Workspace If a page feels boring, empty, or click-heavy: - It’s probably the **wrong level** --- ## Your Specific Cases (Clarified) - **Parent Overview** → Overview - **Family → Children** → Hub - **Select Child** → Workspace - **Instructor → My Classes** → Hub - **Select Class** → Workspace (not a detail page) --- ## The Guiding Rule (Remember This) **Dashboards orient. Hubs are where people live. Workspaces are where work happens.** If you enforce this consistently, the app will: - Feel calmer - Require fewer clicks - Match user expectations naturally
