## 🔧 CHILD PROFILE FIXES

1. ✅ +Add Child Form (Family Manager / Parent View)
- The current modal form is using the outdated version
- Replace with the **new full child profile form** (includes learning style, philosophy, etc.)
1. 🧼 Child Profile View (Admin View)
- Child profile card is **cut off at the bottom** — scrolling is broken
- Ensure full scrollable modal or expandable workspace
- Apply fix to all roles that can view child profiles (Co-op Admin, Instructor)
1. 📍 UI: Move "Edit Profile" button
- Move “Edit Profile” to the **top of the child profile card**
- Keep “Remove/Delete” at the **bottom**
1. ♻️ REMINDER create and Reuse shared components wherever possible

## 📐 DASHBOARD & CARD UI REVIEW

1. 🧾 Children / Enrollments / Sessions Cards
- Current cards are **too large and visually dominant**
- Consider **simplified versions for non-dashboard pages**
- Only show **dashboard-style cards on dashboards**
- Use more compact layouts elsewhere (e.g. profile/workspaces)
1. 🧮 Card Consistency
- Cards should appear **even if the count is zero**
- Remove coloring when 0

1. 🧑‍🏫 Instructor Class Creation
- Required fields:
    - Title
    - Description
    - Start date (cannot be in the past)
    - End date (must be after start)
    - Start time + End time
    - Location (required)
- Validate date logic:
    - No past start dates
    - End date must be same or after start date
1. 📅 Event Creation (New Permissions + Rules)
- Instructors and Parents should be able to create events
- Events require **Co-op Admin approval**
- Required fields:
    - Title
    - Description
    - Date (no past dates)
    - Location
- Add:
    - **Badge + Card indicator** for pending events (like classes)
    - Admin approval flow
