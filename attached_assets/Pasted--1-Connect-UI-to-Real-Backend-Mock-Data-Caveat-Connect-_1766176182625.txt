✅ 1. Connect UI to Real Backend (Mock Data Caveat)

Connect all dashboards to real API data:

Family: class enrollment, RSVPs, child data, calendar

Instructor: classes, rosters, notes, payouts

Admin: class/event creation, approvals, messages, branding

Operator: tenant management, impersonation, email templates

Important: Keep mock/test data where useful for active testing (e.g. in staging seed)

Don’t remove mock data unless a fully working API path replaces it

✅ 2. Fix All Known Functional Issues

Buttons that don’t trigger actions (e.g. class signup, branding save)

Missing or broken route links across dashboards

Instructors can’t draft classes for approval

Cannot manage instructors (create, delete, suspend)

Families can enroll in classes without payment flow

Calendar issues:

Co-op Admin calendar view missing

Items not clickable

“x+ more events” overflow broken

Consider simple weekly/daily view toggle

Cards for classes/events are not clickable or informative

Multiple roles: no way to switch between roles (needs toggle or tab)

✅ 3. Visual, UX & Communication Improvements

Instructor dashboard needs more data and visual hierarchy (students, notes, edit access)

Communications Hub:

Add WYSIWYG/styled layouts (like landing pages)

Simpler logic for automation triggers

Add chat visibility to admin dashboards

Add visual badges/indicators for:

New messages

Pending approvals (dashboards must show this clearly)

Announcement logic:

Show pinned announcements inside the Messages tab for families/instructors

Add stock/AI-chosen visuals for events/classes for better UI engagement

Receipt generator for paid classes (must include child name, class, date, total)

✅ 4. Access, Security & Admin Tools

Add impersonation tool for Bramble to support tenant testing

Confirm Bramble cannot directly edit tenant content

Add soft delete confirmation for critical actions (e.g. delete class/user)

Confirm correct feature visibility for each role

Instructor calendar should show all co-op classes for planning (view-only)

✅ 5. Email System Setup

Simple internal one-way email system for:

Bramble platform admin

Co-op admin

Emails use WYSIWYG editor

Logged only, no external sending (no API/credits)

Set “reply-to” address logic per admin

✅ 6. Template + Demo Content System

Remove old “starter pack” structure

Replace with:

Demo Content: Bramble can preload placeholders for visual appeal (auto-load per new tenant)

Template Manager: Bramble can create/manage global templates (emails, resources, etc.)

✅ 7. Testing & Seed Setup

Add 2 test users for each role (Operator, Admin, Instructor, Family)

Ensure all dashboards and workflows have preloaded content for testing

Keep your internal Routes Page updated — add new links or changed paths as needed

🚫 Do NOT:

Build new features

Enable Stripe or email delivery

Add new APIs

Only use existing routes/components and fix what’s broken or incomplete.
