**Classes / Enrollment**

- It appears a family can enroll the same child multiple times (or the UI allows duplicate enrollment).
- In the **Maria Martinez** family, I already enrolled both children, but the class card still shows an **“Enroll”** button instead of an **“Enrolled”** state.

Please audit and fix the full enrollment flow to ensure:

- No duplicate enrollments are possible (same child → same class)
- UI states are correct and consistent (Enroll vs Enrolled)
- Rosters, counts, and dashboards reflect the true enrollment status

**Events / RSVPs**

Please ensure event RSVPs appear in the correct places across the app, including:

- The event detail page (RSVP status)
- The parent/family schedule view
- The parent overview dashboard “Upcoming schedule” section

Overall request:

Run a full audit of enrollment + RSVP logic as well as all logic so states, routing, and display are clean, predictable, and consistent everywhere.

parent dashboard / overview, classes cards etc  needs to be restructured / designed:

The Parent Dashboard should answer one question:
“What’s useful or relevant for my family right now?”
