TASK: Build Bramble Public Landing Pages (Tied to Co-op Application Flow)

GOAL:
Create the public-facing Bramble website — the entry point for new co-op organizers to discover Bramble, understand what it is, and apply to start a co-op.

This ties directly into the **Co-op Application & Approval Flow** built in the last prompt.
The page at `/start` or `/apply` must route into that flow.

--------------------------------------------------
PAGES TO BUILD
--------------------------------------------------

1) 🌐 Bramble Landing Page
Path: `/`

Purpose:
- Calm, clear homepage for Bramble
- Describes what Bramble is and who it’s for
- Includes CTA to start a co-op

Content Sections:
- Hero: “The invisible operating system for homeschool co-ops.”
- Subhead: “Bramble powers co-ops behind the scenes — quietly, clearly, without replacing what makes them unique.”
- How it works (simple 3-step visual)
- Who it’s for (co-op admins, families, instructors)
- Key features: approvals, classes, curriculum, communication, payments
- CTA: “Start a Co-op” → `/start`
- CTA: “Browse Co-ops” → `/directory`
- Footer: About | Privacy | Terms

Design Notes:
- Calm, neutral colors
- Editorial layout — not corporate SaaS
- Bramble brand should feel like infrastructure (not a product users “join”)

--------------------------------------------------

2) 📝 Start a Co-op Page
Path: `/start` (or `/apply`)

Purpose:
- Kicks off the co-op application flow (see previous prompt)
- Public, no login required

Fields:
- coopName (required)
- location (city/state)
- description
- estimatedSize
- applicantName (required)
- applicantEmail (required)
- applicantPhone (optional)
- whyStartingCoop (optional)
- logoUpload (optional)

Behavior:
- Soft validation on coop name and email (prevent duplicates)
- Submits to CoopApplication DB
- Shows confirmation screen
- Sends confirmation email

🔗 NOTE: This page **feeds into the operator review flow** from the previous task prompt.

--------------------------------------------------

3) 🔍 Co-op Directory Page
Path: `/directory`

Purpose:
- Public list of all **approved + published** co-ops
- Each links to `/c/{co-op-slug}` landing page

Features:
- Search by name or city/state
- Filter by state (optional)
- Clicking a co-op opens its public page

--------------------------------------------------

4) 🧾 About Page
Path: `/about`

Purpose:
- Explain Bramble’s philosophy and differentiation
- Who it’s for
- Why it’s invisible

Copy Suggestions:
- “Bramble isn’t a marketplace or a social network.”
- “It’s quiet, intentional infrastructure built for homeschool communities.”

--------------------------------------------------

5) 📄 Legal Pages
Paths: `/privacy`, `/terms`

Purpose:
- Required for public launch
- Link from footer

--------------------------------------------------

TIE-IN TO PREVIOUS PROMPT:
✅ This public site is the **entry point** into the Co-op Application Flow:
- The `/start` page uses the same form + data model (`CoopApplication`)
- On submit, application goes to `/operator/applications`
- Operator reviews and approves → triggers tenant + admin setup
- Applicant receives magic login link to begin setup

--------------------------------------------------

OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS (Phase 2)
--------------------------------------------------

- Add light SEO meta for “homeschool co-op management software”
- Include testimonials (if available)
- Add “Powered by Bramble” footer link to `/` from all `/c/{co-op-slug}` co-op sites
- Add referrer field to application form (optional tracking)

--------------------------------------------------

SUCCESS CRITERIA
--------------------------------------------------

- Users understand what Bramble is in 10 seconds
- Users can start a co-op without logging in
- All submitted co-op applications route into the operator flow
- Approved co-ops get their own white-labeled site and admin login
