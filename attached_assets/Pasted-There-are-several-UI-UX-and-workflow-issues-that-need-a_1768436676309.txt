There are several UI/UX and workflow issues that need a focused audit and redesign.

**Classes & Events**

- Events are not editable by admins after creation — this must be fixed.
- Instructors currently cannot edit their own classes after creation — this must be fixed.
- Co-op admins should be able to edit and manage **all** classes and instructors within their co-op.

Please clarify and implement consistent admin control logic:

- Co-op admins should have full control over their co-op, including:
    - Classes (create, edit, publish, cancel)
    - Events (create, edit, publish, cancel)
    - Instructor assignments
    - Basic child enrollment data (view/edit where appropriate)
- Platform Admin retains full global control.

**Instructor Experience**

- The Instructor Dashboard needs a full UI/UX overhaul.
- The “My Classes” section is unclear and underdeveloped.
- The “Upcoming Sessions” card is showing outdated content (e.g., *Fall Festival & Harvest Celebration* from last year).
    
    → Upcoming views must only show future sessions and relevant items.
    

**Family Overview / Dashboard**

- The Messages & Announcements card currently acts as a simple link with no visual indication of unread messages.
    - Add clear unread badges or indicators.
    - Ensure consistency between the overview card and the full messages view.
- The Upcoming Events card on the family overview is not clickable.
    - Events should open a modal with key details (date, location, RSVP status).
    - Users should not be forced to navigate away from the dashboard for basic context.
- The dashboard should minimize unnecessary page changes.
    - Parents should be able to view key information without navigating to multiple sections and back.
    - Use modals or inline expansion where appropriate.
- Add an **All Classes** card:
    - Scrollable if there are many classes.
    - Shows available classes, not just enrolled ones.
    - Always visible so parents can discover opportunities easily.

**Overall**

A broader audit of logic, permissions, and UI/UX is needed across the app to:

- Reduce friction
- Improve clarity
- Ensure consistent behavior
- Make the platform feel calm, predictable, and well-organized

Please review the entire site with these principles in mind and propose fixes where patterns are inconsistent or incomplete.
